Hi!

I'm trying to get rid of a textbook that I've had for years. Textbook is Vector Calculus 4th Edition by Susan Jane Colley, and I think this is the current text required for Math019. Used, but no significant marks. I would prefer to get some cash for it but can negotiate the price.

Hey all!

I have two tickets to go see Against the Current on Monday September 20th. It's at the Roxy in downtown LA, you wouldn't have to pay for your ticket, but I do not have transportation. Doors are at 7 pm but bands don't go on until 8. I believe a vaccination card is required.

Hi everyone,

Still no sign of the pink knit throw blanket. It was last seen Sunday night on the laundry room counter, and I checked the laundry room mid-Monday. The blanket has real sentimental value, so I would deeply appreciate it if the person who took it could return it. You can even just leave it in the laundry room, really just want it back :((

Hello,

My scooter was stolen/missing today this morning in front of the Shanahan cafe. It is a Razor A6 scooter with black wheels/handlebars and a silver aluminum build. Also, my name (in all upper cases) is on the joint connecting the base and handle as well as the bottom. Here is a picture for reference: Amazon.com: Razor A6 Kick Scooter - Silver : Toys &amp; Games
Please help me find my scooter! Any information will be greatly appreciated.

Also, according to Campus Security, thefts of bicycles, scooters, skateboards, etc. have been on a steep rise these past several weeks. Keep your stuff safe!

Stay safe,

Hey y‚Äôall:

I‚Äôm looking for an adapter for one of these cords (see picture attached) to be able to project video for a thing next week Saturday. My ports are all USB-C, but I have no idea what this other port would be called/what kind of adapter would work for it/if it even exists. Do any of y‚Äôall have any idea? If you have an adapter and are willing to lend it for most of the day Saturday (I pick it up Friday evening type thing) is love it, but I can also order one. Thanks so much for your help!

i bought a standard full-size skateboard at the beginning of this semester, but i've stopped riding it after falling and hurting my wrist a few times too many. i miss zooming around campus though, so i'd like to upgrade to a longboard since i might actually fit on it and not subject myself to stress fractures.

please let me know if you have a longboard you're looking to part ways with and/or if you're interested in a lightly used skateboard.

My Playshion longboard was stolen last night, last seen outside of Mcgregor. 

It's got some random political stickers on the bottom and it's chipped in the front. 


I doubt I'm getting it back so I'm in search of a new longboard/skateboard anyone wants to give up. I am willing to pay.

Looking for a long board that was probably stolen last night. It was a Gravity Mini-Carve 42 inch with a Hawaiian pattern on the bottom and a kick-tail (see attached). It was sitting by the main door to Drinkward, so some scumbag at the bar last night must've gotten it then. The board is over a decade old and is cracked in the middle, so it's worth almost nothing to anyone but me. It also isn't in production anymore so finding it is imperative.

If anyone has seen this board or has ANY inclination as to who might have stolen it, PLEASE EMAIL ME. There is a 10 dollar reward for good information, and a 100 dollar reward for information that leads me to the board.

    A game of chess

We have wayyy too much super yummy food that we just can‚Äôt finish, if only there was someone to help us. If you can do this, I have on someone‚Äôs honor that Stephanie Huang will personally thank you by looking briefly in your direction, and, if The Lord Himself (or whomever you may worship, if anyone) lets it be, exhales at a slightly higher volume than regular.

Dear Mudders,

TLDR: Are you free Saturday from 12pm-3pm or Sunday from 12pm-3pm? Volunteer with PAPS (Prison Abolition Prisoner Support), a Texas based abolitionist org, to notify incarcerated people about receiving stimulus checks. We will be responding to letters in the white tents next to Keck. Fill out this spreadsheet.

LONG:

My name is Saachi Patel and I am a volunteer coordinator at PAPS (Prison Abolition Prisoner Support). Our main function as an organization is pen pal writing with incarcerated folks. Last year, Lieff Cabraser filed a lawsuit against the IRS in ‚ÄúScholl v. Mnuchin‚Äù for improper withholding of CARES Act stimulus funds from over 1.5 million incarcerated Americans and their families. In October 2020, incarcerated folks were now eligible to file for stimulus checks. PAPS notified over 3,000 incarcerated people across 50 states on how to file for their stimulus checks. 

While people have successfully received their money, many people have not for the following reasons: 1) The IRS has been withholding filled out tax forms in their offices and not filing for incarcerated folks. 2) Correction officers have been stealing checks. 3) People have been using the identities of incarcerated people to file for stimulus checks without their consent. These are just a few of the many problems and injustices incarcerated people face on the inside. 

We have over 500 letters we need to respond to regarding concerns about not receiving stimulus checks. The deadlines for filing with 2021 tax forms all end before the new year so it is critical that we respond ASAP. But I need your help because I cannot respond to all of these by myself. 

If you are free please Saturday from 12pm-3pm or Sunday from 12pm-3pm, fill out this spreadsheet. You do not have to attend all sessions to help out, but I do ask that you commit to the full 3 hours for the session you choose. The process to respond will be pretty simple. We will have to sort the mail based on questions and concerns. Then we will stuff envelopes with pre-written responses and address them accordingly. If you can, please bring your laptop because certain tasks require the internet and access to spreadsheets. 

Warning: Some of the letters have been peed on by a cat, so we will be working outside with gloves. I have personally gone through the mail and it does not smell or visibly look peed on, but I do have to be transparent about this incase y‚Äôall have allergies to cats. 

We are in need of supplies, so if you can donate any of these items, please indicate how many you can bring on the spreadsheet:

    Gloves

    Sanitizer

    Stamps

    Black ink pens


Thank you so much for taking the time to read this ridiculously long email. I know finals are coming up and we all have very busy schedules, but taking a couple hours of your day to help respond to these letters will help so many people on the inside. Please email me with any questions!

Best,

Saachi

Hey y'all,

My friend recently found his missing stuff from storage in someone else's room, and that gave me hope, so I wanted to make one last attempt at recovering my boxes. If you have a random microwave and/or a normal cardboard box with a red flannel field hockey blanket in it (or if you happened to live in 324C over the summer and saw it then), please let me know! 

Thank you!!

Please let me know if you have any information about the board. I have also attached a photo of what it looks like. I am willing to compensate $15 for anyone who can help me get it back.

Hi Jonathan (and anyone who may have lost their board/other valuables),

Just a reminder to also fill out the ASHMC report form for lost/stolen items! You can find it here. Best of luck!

I have a driving test this Thursday at 9am and I don't have a car. Could someone let me borrow/rent a car from 8am to 12pm? If you could come to the driving test with me that would be great. If not, I have a friend who does not have a car but has a license who's willing to go with me.

I have a DMV behind-the-wheel test on Feb 3rd Thursday and I need a buddy with a valid CA license accompanying me. Time will be from 11:30AM to 1:40PM the latest (depending on Rancho DMV efficiency). 

You can just sit in the car going there and back and present your license at DMV.

I can pay you 16$ per hour and lunch from when we leave the campus to when we come back.

Fax, if someone stole my muffin, they‚Äôd be catching these hands.

Seriously though, not to harp on it too much, but this is really not cool and unfortunately not the first incident of its kind. It speaks more generally to an emerging pattern of disrespect for fellow students which harms the overall community and the spirit of what makes Mudd such an amazing place. My hope is that we can all cultivate a deeper empathy that extends just as far to our fellow Mudders as it does to our friends and loved ones. There is strength in that.

Hi All, 

Two nights ago my hamster ran away, and despite intensive searching I have not been able to find him. Please let me know if you have seen him. His last known location was on the East side of Atwood, facing Case. His name is Ghaerrheii and his favorite food is honeycrisp apples and broccoli. 

See pictures below for what he looks like.

    Hi All, 

    Two nights ago my hamster ran away, and despite intensive searching I have not been able to find him. Please let me know if you have seen him. His last known location was on the East side of Atwood, facing Case. His name is Ghaerrheii and his favorite food is honeycrisp apples and broccoli. 

    See pictures below for what he looks like.

Hello Friends,

I'm going to the magic castle on Thursday afternoon. If anyone has a pair of dress shoes size 10-11.5 that you would let me wear for Thursday, that would be greatly appreciated. If the shoes are a little outside that size range, I'd still be willing to try, because shoe sizes are inconsistent. 

Thank you,
Mason Acevedo

I lost my tape measure around a week ago, the last time I saw it was in Shan 2465 when we were setting up the escape room for MuddEscapes. Picture below. It also has light green washi tape on the back with my name written on it. Let me know if you find it!

Hello friends,
I am starting work immediately next week and have no idea how I‚Äôm going to get my car back up home to Seattle for the summer. If you are planning on going up to the area (even as far south as Portland) sometime soon and are looking to do a road trip, I would pay 300 dollars to have someone drive up my car (2018 Suburu Outback - super safe, normal fuel efficiency). I‚Äôm also definitely willing to negotiate the payment amount. The drive is pretty nice (except the south/central California bit) and super nice if you drive up the coast, which is absolutely beautiful and has great camping options. Please let me know!!! And if you know of anyone that could be interested, please pass this info along!
Thanks,
Rox ‚Äúbad at planning‚Äù anne

        Hello friends,
        I am starting work immediately next week and have no idea how I‚Äôm going to get my car back up home to Seattle for the summer. If you are planning on going up to the area (even as far south as Portland) sometime soon and are looking to do a road trip, I would pay 300 dollars to have someone drive up my car (2018 Suburu Outback - super safe, normal fuel efficiency). I‚Äôm also definitely willing to negotiate the payment amount. The drive is pretty nice (except the south/central California bit) and super nice if you drive up the coast, which is absolutely beautiful and has great camping options. Please let me know!!! And if you know of anyone that could be interested, please pass this info along!
        Thanks,

Hi! 

I am working for an evil company that shall not be named this summer. They have offered me tons of benefits, including $350 to go to a bike/lock/helmet. I already have an (albeit crappy) bike so I‚Äôm willing to grab a new bike for the summer and then somehow get it to Claremont and give it to someone else. If you are in need of a bike, reach out and we‚Äôll make something happen. I‚Äôd like to prioritize people who wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be able to afford a bike if possible, thanks!

Updated offer because of how many people are in need!!

MM for sure. I turned my phone off to talk to my sister and I have a dozen emails. To clarify, I can get you a free bike, helmet, and u-lock. I‚Äôm sorry to hear about all the bikes that have been stolen this semester and I will be taking a little while to decide what I‚Äôm going to do and will reach out to a couple people based off need :) also to clarify further I will not accept any money!!!

The penny board and help paying for a bike are still up for grabs. I love you all have the best day!! P.S. Walmart has some $100 bikes with good reviews. We had one of this brand for little guests and it works well!

Hello, 

I have a rosy boa who needs caretaking this July and August. She‚Äôs pretty low maintenance and comes with all the supplies except more frozen mice. Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested and I can give more details. She already has a new home set up in Fall, so unfortunately she is not up for permanent ownership.

Best,
Marissa

Good morning

Thank you for the inquiry regarding the cylinders.   The requested cylinder is not available at this time so I have quoted two alternates.

I also quoted the air freight to receive items on Thursday.

 

I need the order before 11 AM eastern time to ship today.

One of the Muchachos speakers. It looks like the one below, it came from the back room behind the gym, I've been told it was taken sometime in March / April. If you know any dorms, clubs, or people that borrowed a speaker around that time, let me know!

Hello,

Does anyone know what this type of connector is called for this GPS receiver? And on the off chance someone has an adapter for this to usb, is there any chance I could borrow it for a couple days? I found an adapter online but it will take a couple of days to ship and I was hoping to use it tomorrow.

Thank you,

Hello, 

I am looking for someone to take care of my snake Rosie from July 3rd til research is done. She‚Äôs lower maintenance than a plant. Plus super docile so you can play w her. She just needs water changed every couple of days and to be fed maybe once a week while you have her. I‚Äôll make sure everything is clean and such so there is no other maintenance. 

Best,

Hi! Someone has left their rice cooker on ‚Äúkeep warm‚Äù for about three hours now but there is only a towel inside. If this is yours I have unplugged it for fire safety reasons.

Kaitlynn ‚Äúhopefully I don‚Äôt mess up what you were using the rice cooker for‚Äù Gray

Hi yall,

I know someone who is looking for Intro to CS tutoring around the Claremont / Rancho Cucamonga area. Here's some context:

    My girlfriend is just getting started and would like to be a full stack developer.


    She‚Äôs new to I.T. (Less than 3 months). This effort is to help her.


    We have no idea for curriculum at all ‚Äî so‚Ä¶ the learning style/path would be on your end/your friends.


    We looked at online resources like coding dojo, Codesmith, General assembly, etc. but surprisingly nearly all of them are lax on attendance, and some don‚Äôt even require it. That was telling for me. So we decided to go the one-on-one route.

    She really needs someone that can answer questions and explain things.

    She works full time but has no problem being coached and taught as often during the week as you can.

    The restraint on time is based off of your availability. Apart from that it‚Äôs just a matter of her self-studying.

    Eventually she wants to become certified.

    She‚Äôs been watching the intro to CS via Harvard‚Äôs educational portal (a recommendation from someone online).


    We were hoping for $40/hr
    35-50 hours for Python
    35-50 for Java.


I think they are looking for people with some amount of teaching and research experience. Feel free to email Thisisdavidrogers@icloud.com and jenae.cabot@gmail.com if you are interested.

Hello,

My name is Dylan Tran and I'm interested in this teaching opportunity. 

I believe I would be an excellent fit for this role. I'm a software engineer at Everlaw and can give a lot of advice on industry standards and practices. I'm proficient in both Python and Java.

In the past, I worked with Santi to compete in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). I'm currently a grutor for Mudd's Data Structure and Programming development. My prior teaching experience is that I tutored the competitive programming team and the competitive algebra 2 team in high school. I have also given an intro to computer science lecture in Java to the Girl Who Code Club at my high school. In fact, I still have the curriculum outline and slides.

I have attached my resume which contains my prior work experiences. 

Warmly,
Dylan Tran

    Hi yall,

    I know someone who is looking for Intro to CS tutoring around the Claremont / Rancho Cucamonga area. Here's some context:

        My girlfriend is just getting started and would like to be a full stack developer.


        She‚Äôs new to I.T. (Less than 3 months). This effort is to help her.


        We have no idea for curriculum at all ‚Äî so‚Ä¶ the learning style/path would be on your end/your friends.


        We looked at online resources like coding dojo, Codesmith, General assembly, etc. but surprisingly nearly all of them are lax on attendance, and some don‚Äôt even require it. That was telling for me. So we decided to go the one-on-one route.

        She really needs someone that can answer questions and explain things.

        She works full time but has no problem being coached and taught as often during the week as you can.

        The restraint on time is based off of your availability. Apart from that it‚Äôs just a matter of her self-studying.

        Eventually she wants to become certified.

        She‚Äôs been watching the intro to CS via Harvard‚Äôs educational portal (a recommendation from someone online).


        We were hoping for $40/hr
        35-50 hours for Python
        35-50 for Java.


    I think they are looking for people with some amount of teaching and research experience. Feel free to email Thisisdavidrogers@icloud.com and jenae.cabot@gmail.com if you are interested.

    Best,
    Santi

Hey everyone!

Turns out that the Summer Proctors have money to spend!

So we thought it'd be great to celebrate with some Handel's ice cream today in Drinkward courtyard at 3 PM:). It'll be BYOB (bring your own bowls, or cups... whatever).

I was wondering what people‚Äôs plans are for summer storage (from around July 22nd to when we get back for fall). I would be interested if someone is getting a pod and has space for another person (I don‚Äôt have too much stuff). Also could organize another storage pod if enough people are interested.
Thanks,

If anyone has a dolly or something similar that I could borrow later today, or knows where I could find one, I'd really appreciate it!

Hello,
I have a flight that departs at 6:30PM from the Ontario airport on July 23rd. Not sure if anyone else is also heading to the airport at the same time, but if there is, we should uber-pool (if that's even a thing lol). If not I'd compensate in gas money for a ride over there. I'm not sure if anyone has access to the zip cars on campus, but I'd compensate for that as well.
Thanks!
Jacoby

I'm leaving Claremont on Sunday and need to move a few boxes' worth of things + a digital piano from AV to a storage unit in town this weekend (preferably Saturday). Because of the size of my items, I'll need an SUV or similar-sized car. Please reach out if you're willing to help or have any questions.

Thanks,

Hi all,

My black plastic plate disappeared from the Drinkward kitchen on Wednesday night. It has a white sticker on the bottom with ""Hall"" written on it (it might be hard to read). If you've seen it and/or borrowed it without realizing it belonged to somebody, could you let me know?

Thanks!

I was kinda dumb and have been forgetting my skateboard outside of Galileo. Today I realized it wasn't there :( It is black on the bottom and has thick blue wheels. If you grabbed it thinking it was abandoned or have seen it around I'd really love it back.

Hi Ethan,

I need to get this card reader over to you. Is there a time today (Tuesday) when it would be convenient to meet? My schedule is extremely flexible (except that I am up late, so probably not 8AM).

There are a bunch of misc details I want to remember to tell you so I'm putting some of them here.

The card reader has a regular old USB interface and presents as a serial port, not as a keyboard. If serial port is a problem, let me know. I don't know that I can change it, but there is one thing I would try. You need to set the baud rate to 57600. Wave a card over it and you will get something like

    %E?;0402103251?

probably followed by <CR> and <LF>.

While the five undergrad colleges have eight-digit ID numbers, TCCS, CGU, and KGI have nine-digit numbers, so they pad ours with a zero on the left. The last digit is that issue number they tick up by one every time they reissue a lost card. You should just ignore the trailing issue digit and trim off any leading zero. That CGU person would show up like  %E?;2540884031?  assuming an issue digit of 1.

There are multiple card handling systems in Claremont. HMC has our own made by Lenel. TCCS has one called Transact that used to be called Blackboard. You will see Blackboard's ""Bb"" logo on the USB card reader as well as on laundry readers in the dorms and possibly some vending machine readers. The readers that let you check your balance in Jay's Place and the Cafe probably still have the ""Bb"" logo. The cash registers in Hoch, Jay's and Cafe got replaced recently so they probably have the new name, Transact. Anything that deals with money goes through the Transact system. The Transact system is also what prints the cards at the Connection. We load ID numbers and photos into Transact and then they print the cards. At the moment you have to bring a newly replaced card from the Connection back to F&M in Platt so they can update the issue number and capture the serial number into Lenel. I'm working on streamlining that.

The chip in our ID cards is made by Sony. They call it FeliCa (Felicity Card). It is widely used in Japan, and almost never in the US. Claremont might be the last remaining FeliCa user in the US. Blackboard/Transact made a bad guess when choosing a chip technology 15 or 20 years ago. Legitimate readers probably require a license from Sony, and since it is so rare, very few generic readers can read the contents.

You have already discovered that the factory serial number on the FeliCa card is readable. My Android phone can read it with ""NFC Tools"" and suchlike. I don't know if you can use NFC Tools on an iPhone since Apple is inflexible about access to the NFC. We capture and record that serial number in Lenel because half of the locks on campus read the serial number rather than the ID number written into the chip. All of the locks in McGregor except for one read the FeliCa chip. The one exception is a street level entry door on Platt Blvd. Those readers usually have a curvy front and say ""HID iClass"" near the bottom. The rest of the locks in McGregor (and dorms like Atwood) are made by Assa Abloy. So, curvy front, usually mounted to a wall means HID iClass; it reads the serial number and sends it to Lenel. Bulgy rectangular front means Assa Abloy; it reads the ID number from the chip and sends that to Lenel.

You won't be able to read cards for CMC. They use a different card technology called HID iClass (yes, the same company as our wall readers). You can read their cards with a magstripe reader. Do you have one? The ID number is on stripe #2 which is what most generic magstripe readers read. I will be trying to get them to switch to another chip technology, but this problem will persist at least through this school year and perhaps longer.

There's more to the story with the FeliCa cards issued by the Transact system. FeliCa and most other NFC cards just have 1K to 4K bytes of memory and some kind of password protection for reading and writing. Our cards issued by the Transact system use use Transact's own secret way of recording the ID number. They store up to three numbers on the card, or more accurately and commonly, the same ID number written into three different locations in the card's memory. Transact calls these locations T2Data, DACardData, and EXTCardData. I believe they use an AES encryption key for each of these, and since the same key encrypts and decrypts (i.e. not using public key), they are very secretive about the keys used. The names for the storage slots mean, respectively, the data they would write on Track 2 (T2) of the magstripe, the data used for Door Access (DA), and the copy of the data used by EXTernal vendors such as Assa Abloy. I suspect the encryption keys are different for each slot.

Pomona, Scripps, and Pitzer use Blackboard/Transact branded door access readers (i.e. they don't have separate Lenel systems). Those door readers probably read the DACardData slot decrypting it with the appropriate key. Transact will contract with 3rd party lock makers such as Assa Abloy, but they don't want to share the encryption key used for the T2Data slot so they have a different AES key for the EXTCardData slot. Cards that we printed long ago didn't get the EXTCardData written with the ID number, so F&M has a special Blackboard card reader attached to a Mac at the front desk the sole function of which is to read the ID number from the T2Data slot and re-write it to the EXTCardData slot.

Transact puts an encoder module in the card printers at the Connection that have the secret encryption keys embedded in them. The USB card reader also has the T2Data key in it so it can read the slot on the FeliCa card, decrypt it, and send it out the serial port.

More common chip technologies are Mifare and DESfire. I will be working on trying to move Claremont to one of those, probably DESfire. The reader I will bring you is FeliCa-only. I have three of them. I rescued them from E-waste when they were replaced at Hoch, Jay's and Cafe. They will work fine for now (again, except for CMC cards). In principle we should be able to write into our own slot in the chip memory. I will be exploring this too, and I don't know enough of the technical details, so I welcome any insights. The idea would be to write the ID number into our own slot on a more common chip such as DESfire so that we (i.e. you) could read it using commodity NFC readers and we would not be beholden to Transact and their secret encryption keys.

There is another issue on my radar. When a card is lost, it is replaced with a new card that has the next sequential issue digit. It is an understatement to say that this is lame. I believe that for other reasons (such as Mobile Credential--using your phone as your access) it is necessary to move to a model where we (Claremont) acquire a unique ISO 6-digit prefix and begin issuing 16-digit credit-card-style numbers as the ""card number"". A lost card would be re-issued with a new 16-digit card number that bore no resemblance to the old card number. (N.B. Student ID would still be printed on the card and would not change upon reissue). In this scenario, the number you read from the card would be 16 digits and would be unrelated to the student ID number.

This is a long way off and is just a heads-up to think about the future necessity of doing some kind of external lookup with the 16-digit card number to find out the student ID number.

Hello Andy,

This is superb. Thank you for taking the time to write this email and compile this information. Could I meet you at 2:45pm in Sprauge?

I have used both NFC tools and an expensive Felica reader from sony to read the cards, but both indeed only got the serial number, not the CX number.

As for what we do, yes, we currently just use the magstripe reader for most things. I believe that's acceptable for some parts of our operation but obviously not ideal. I would place the tap card reader in the tool checkout cage which would speed up our checking out operations significantly. We check out anywhere from 5-50 items per shift, and it's very annoying especially if the person keeps their ID in a wallet or protective case. We can discuss this more in person but another goal is that our card reader could rewrite the T2Data to EXTCardData so that we would not have to send off-campus students to F&M, which is a surprisingly hard task to do.

I've worked with serial devices quite a bit on a lower level, so the reader connecting as a serial device should be fine. I'm thinking to write a small program that acts as an intercept for the reader. First, it would check if the data in T2Data and EXTCardData were identical. If they were not, it would prompt them to copy it over. If they were the same, it would simply type the keyboard strokes of the ID card with some simple formatting for my checkout kiosk. Would this be possible?

Additionally, I don't know about the exact legality of this, but I would like to attempt to find the encryption key. However, that's a stretch goal for now, maybe something I'll look into over fall break.

I completely agree with you that sequential issue digits are lme. The new system you propose would be great if TCCS could provide an API endpoint to get student information from that ""credit card"" number. Of course they could restrict access to it with api keys, but I believe it's still necessary for several organizations that are not strictly part of admin to be able to read the student info from their card. But that also is just a thought.

Thanks again,
Ethan

    Hi Ethan,

    I need to get this card reader over to you. Is there a time today (Tuesday) when it would be convenient to meet? My schedule is extremely flexible (except that I am up late, so probably not 8AM).

    There are a bunch of misc details I want to remember to tell you so I'm putting some of them here.

    The card reader has a regular old USB interface and presents as a serial port, not as a keyboard. If serial port is a problem, let me know. I don't know that I can change it, but there is one thing I would try. You need to set the baud rate to 57600. Wave a card over it and you will get something like

    This is superb. Thank you for taking the time to write this email and compile this information. Could I meet you at 2:45pm in Sprauge?

    I have used both NFC tools and an expensive Felica reader from sony to read the cards, but both indeed only got the serial number, not the CX number.

    As for what we do, yes, we currently just use the magstripe reader for most things. I believe that's acceptable for some parts of our operation but obviously not ideal. I would place the tap card reader in the tool checkout cage which would speed up our checking out operations significantly. We check out anywhere from 5-50 items per shift, and it's very annoying especially if the person keeps their ID in a wallet or protective case. We can discuss this more in person but another goal is that our card reader could rewrite the T2Data to EXTCardData so that we would not have to send off-campus students to F&M, which is a surprisingly hard task to do.

    I've worked with serial devices quite a bit on a lower level, so the reader connecting as a serial device should be fine. I'm thinking to write a small program that acts as an intercept for the reader. First, it would check if the data in T2Data and EXTCardData were identical. If they were not, it would prompt them to copy it over. If they were the same, it would simply type the keyboard strokes of the ID card with some simple formatting for my checkout kiosk. Would this be possible?

    Additionally, I don't know about the exact legality of this, but I would like to attempt to find the encryption key. However, that's a stretch goal for now, maybe something I'll look into over fall break.

    I completely agree with you that sequential issue digits are lme. The new system you propose would be great if TCCS could provide an API endpoint to get student information from that ""credit card"" number. Of course they could restrict access to it with api keys, but I believe it's still necessary for several organizations that are not strictly part of admin to be able to read the student info from their card. But that also is just a thought.

    Thanks again,
    Ethan

        Hi Ethan,

        I need to get this card reader over to you. Is there a time today (Tuesday) when it would be convenient to meet? My schedule is extremely flexible (except that I am up late, so probably not 8AM).

        There are a bunch of misc details I want to remember to tell you so I'm putting some of them here.

        The card reader has a regular old USB interface and presents as a serial port, not as a keyboard. If serial port is a problem, let me know. I don't know that I can change it, but there is one thing I would try. You need to set the baud rate to 57600. Wave a card over it and you will get something like

            %E?;0402103251?

        probably followed by <CR> and <LF>.

        While the five undergrad colleges have eight-digit ID numbers, TCCS, CGU, and KGI have nine-digit numbers, so they pad ours with a zero on the left. The last digit is that issue number they tick up by one every time they reissue a lost card. You should just ignore the trailing issue digit and trim off any leading zero. That CGU person would show up like  %E?;2540884031?  assuming an issue digit of 1.

        There are multiple card handling systems in Claremont. HMC has our own made by Lenel. TCCS has one called Transact that used to be called Blackboard. You will see Blackboard's ""Bb"" logo on the USB card reader as well as on laundry readers in the dorms and possibly some vending machine readers. The readers that let you check your balance in Jay's Place and the Cafe probably still have the ""Bb"" logo. The cash registers in Hoch, Jay's and Cafe got replaced recently so they probably have the new name, Transact. Anything that deals with money goes through the Transact system. The Transact system is also what prints the cards at the Connection. We load ID numbers and photos into Transact and then they print the cards. At the moment you have to bring a newly replaced card from the Connection back to F&M in Platt so they can update the issue number and capture the serial number into Lenel. I'm working on streamlining that.

        The chip in our ID cards is made by Sony. They call it FeliCa (Felicity Card). It is widely used in Japan, and almost never in the US. Claremont might be the last remaining FeliCa user in the US. Blackboard/Transact made a bad guess when choosing a chip technology 15 or 20 years ago. Legitimate readers probably require a license from Sony, and since it is so rare, very few generic readers can read the contents.

        You have already discovered that the factory serial number on the FeliCa card is readable. My Android phone can read it with ""NFC Tools"" and suchlike. I don't know if you can use NFC Tools on an iPhone since Apple is inflexible about access to the NFC. We capture and record that serial number in Lenel because half of the locks on campus read the serial number rather than the ID number written into the chip. All of the locks in McGregor except for one read the FeliCa chip. The one exception is a street level entry door on Platt Blvd. Those readers usually have a curvy front and say ""HID iClass"" near the bottom. The rest of the locks in McGregor (and dorms like Atwood) are made by Assa Abloy. So, curvy front, usually mounted to a wall means HID iClass; it reads the serial number and sends it to Lenel. Bulgy rectangular front means Assa Abloy; it reads the ID number from the chip and sends that to Lenel.

        You won't be able to read cards for CMC. They use a different card technology called HID iClass (yes, the same company as our wall readers). You can read their cards with a magstripe reader. Do you have one? The ID number is on stripe #2 which is what most generic magstripe readers read. I will be trying to get them to switch to another chip technology, but this problem will persist at least through this school year and perhaps longer.

        There's more to the story with the FeliCa cards issued by the Transact system. FeliCa and most other NFC cards just have 1K to 4K bytes of memory and some kind of password protection for reading and writing. Our cards issued by the Transact system use use Transact's own secret way of recording the ID number. They store up to three numbers on the card, or more accurately and commonly, the same ID number written into three different locations in the card's memory. Transact calls these locations T2Data, DACardData, and EXTCardData. I believe they use an AES encryption key for each of these, and since the same key encrypts and decrypts (i.e. not using public key), they are very secretive about the keys used. The names for the storage slots mean, respectively, the data they would write on Track 2 (T2) of the magstripe, the data used for Door Access (DA), and the copy of the data used by EXTernal vendors such as Assa Abloy. I suspect the encryption keys are different for each slot.

        Pomona, Scripps, and Pitzer use Blackboard/Transact branded door access readers (i.e. they don't have separate Lenel systems). Those door readers probably read the DACardData slot decrypting it with the appropriate key. Transact will contract with 3rd party lock makers such as Assa Abloy, but they don't want to share the encryption key used for the T2Data slot so they have a different AES key for the EXTCardData slot. Cards that we printed long ago didn't get the EXTCardData written with the ID number, so F&M has a special Blackboard card reader attached to a Mac at the front desk the sole function of which is to read the ID number from the T2Data slot and re-write it to the EXTCardData slot.

        Transact puts an encoder module in the card printers at the Connection that have the secret encryption keys embedded in them. The USB card reader also has the T2Data key in it so it can read the slot on the FeliCa card, decrypt it, and send it out the serial port.

        More common chip technologies are Mifare and DESfire. I will be working on trying to move Claremont to one of those, probably DESfire. The reader I will bring you is FeliCa-only. I have three of them. I rescued them from E-waste when they were replaced at Hoch, Jay's and Cafe. They will work fine for now (again, except for CMC cards). In principle we should be able to write into our own slot in the chip memory. I will be exploring this too, and I don't know enough of the technical details, so I welcome any insights. The idea would be to write the ID number into our own slot on a more common chip such as DESfire so that we (i.e. you) could read it using commodity NFC readers and we would not be beholden to Transact and their secret encryption keys.

        There is another issue on my radar. When a card is lost, it is replaced with a new card that has the next sequential issue digit. It is an understatement to say that this is lame. I believe that for other reasons (such as Mobile Credential--using your phone as your access) it is necessary to move to a model where we (Claremont) acquire a unique ISO 6-digit prefix and begin issuing 16-digit credit-card-style numbers as the ""card number"". A lost card would be re-issued with a new 16-digit card number that bore no resemblance to the old card number. (N.B. Student ID would still be printed on the card and would not change upon reissue). In this scenario, the number you read from the card would be 16 digits and would be unrelated to the student ID number.

        This is a long way off and is just a heads-up to think about the future necessity of doing some kind of external lookup with the 16-digit card number to find out the student ID number.

        Andy

Hello fellow Drinkwardigans,

Short
We're building a bar for the dorm! Please reply with any thoughts on a bar or if you want to help design/build, especially if you've been a bartender.

Long
Our fine dorm has been embarrassed for far too long with lack of adequate bartending facilities. Our poor bartenders must stoop low over our ugly excuse for a bar in the form of a knee-high dresser to mix drinks. Why should our glorious temple of a dorm be so disgraced by such a lack of furnishings when we are surrounded by such bounty?? This true injustice must not stand- it is time for us to build a bar.

We would love to collect any thoughts and opinions from the dorm about a bar so we can make it best serve the community. Especially if you've been a bartender: things that are crucial in a bar? The worst parts of other bars you've used? If you want to help, also let us know.


We're so extremely excited to bring Drinkward the glory it deserves!!

It's a standard Drinkward metal room key, with a pink key ring cover and an S-biner attached to it (see sketch attached). Probably lost around Drinkward sometime between 12 and 6 today. Luckily I had my door deadbolted open but still need to find it somewhere.

I went to ice cream club at approximately 2:01 and by approximately 2:06 i did not know where my mug with ice cream went. I looked everywhere. I have no memory of the day so I‚Äôm struggling to think up where it could be. It‚Äôs somewhat sentimental so please if you find it let me know! It is a grassy green color.

Hey y‚Äôall,

If you‚Äôre on Drinkward 3rd floor and own this cologne, I believe I accidentally knocked it onto the ground when trying to get something from my locker. From what I can tell, none of the cologne is gone but the bottle is slightly cracked. Hopefully everything is all right but if the bottle was super important to you let me know and we can try to hash something out.

Hi fantabulous friends,

I have a super long-shot request:

I need a ride to Palos Verdes on Wednesday, leaving at around noon and arriving back to mudd at around 6:30. It‚Äôs a long ass drive, so it would involve staying in Palos for the entire time. Ill pay the equivalent of a two-way uber plus some as gas money / payment for your time ($200). I‚Äôd just rather be in a car with a person I trust than a stranger, considering ~certain circumstances~. I promise I‚Äôm a kinda cool person to hang out with most of the time. 

Yours in good vibes,

I‚Äôd just rather be in a car with a person I trust than a stranger, considering ~certain circumstances~. I promise I‚Äôm a kinda cool person to hang out with most of the time. 

    Yours in good vibes,

Calling All Boxed Wine Connesieurs of Atwood!

With social probation plaguing our place of residence, it would seem we have no choice but to get smashed in the safety of our own suites* and stumble down to Toga party this Friday.

Your Atwood Presidents cordially invite you to join us in Fratwood and Firewood to slap wine bags and tie togas** before we stumble down to Pomona. Word on the street is that a special glass boot may be in attendance. If you're extra lucky, you'll end up like Tejas***

Remember that we ARE on social probation and gatherings of 20+ are prohibited in the courtyard; please do not break this rule or we will be on social probation for the rest of the semester****

Happy future slapping,
